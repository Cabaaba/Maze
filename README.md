# Maze
 Maze solver which analyes only adjacent cells 



Initially meant to be a throwaway code, but I found movements of '@' sign amusing.



input.txt should be placed in the same folder as executable and contain input in the following format

' ' - walkable space

'#' - wall

's' - start

'f' - finish

'\n' - end of maze row

anything else - you want to produce an exception.



It's better to surround your maze by walls. Otherwise, the agent can move infinitely.
